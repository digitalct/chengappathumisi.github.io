part of the whole two volumes, and contains a few documents describing

but are not in its own manuals, notably <i>pic</i> and <i>tbl</i>.
Some are just neat, like <i>pico</i>.

<h2>
C and its immediate ancestors
</h2>
<p>

<ul>

<li> <a href="bcpl.html">BCPL Reference Manual</a> by Martin Richards, dated July 1967.
The language described here supplied the basis for much of our own work and that
of others.  The linked page discusses the circumstances, while
the files linked under it have the manual itself.

<p>
<li><a href="kbman.html">Users' Reference to B</a>, which describes
the B programming language; it is by Ken Thompson and describes
the PDP-11 version.
<p>
<li><a href="bintro.html">CSTR #8</a> also describes
the B programming language; it is for the GCOS version
on Honeywell equipment.  It is by Johnson and Kernighan.

<p>
<li>Resurrection of two
<A href="primevalC.html">primeval C compilers</A> from 1972-73,
including source.  You won't be able to compile it with
today's compilers, but the link points to someone who succeeded in reviving
one of them.

<p>
<li>The version of the
C Reference Manual
<a href="cman.ps">Postscript</a> (250KB) or
<a href="cman.pdf">PDF</a>, (79K)
that came with 6th Edition Unix (May 1975), in the second volume entitled
``Documents for Use With the Unix Time-sharing System''.
For completeness,
there are also versions of Kernighan's
tutorial on C, in <A href="ctut.ps">Postscript</A> or
<A href="ctut.pdf">PDF</A> format.

<p>
There is also a slightly earlier (January 1974) version of the C manual,
in the form of an uninterpreted PDF scan of a Bell Labs
Technical Memorandum, visible <A href="cman74.pdf"> here</A>,
if you can accommodate 1.9MB.
<p>
No updated version of this manual was distributed with
most machine readable versions of the 7th Edition,
since the first edition of the `white book'
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language">K&amp;R</a>
was published about the same time.  The tutorial was greatly
expanded into the bulk of the book,
and the manual became the book's Appendix A.
<p>
However, it turns out that the paper copies of the 7th Edition
manual
that we printed locally include not only what
became Appendix A of K&R 1, but also a page entitled
"Recent Changes to C", and I retyped this.  I haven't
been able to track down the contemporary machine-readable
version (it's possible that some tapes were produced that
included it).  This is available in
<A href="cchanges.ps">PostScript</A> or <A href="cchanges.pdf">PDF</A>
format.

<p>
The structure and even many bits of
wording of the manual survived into K&amp;R I and thence into the ANSI/ISO standard
for the language.

<p>
<li>
A Bell Labs CS Tech. Report (#102) by Steve Johnson and me
discusses issues involved in designing a calling
sequence for C on various machines.
It is from 1981, and thus pre-ANSI,
but the issues haven't really changed.  Available as
<A href="clcs.html">HTML</A>,
<A href="clcs.pdf">PDF</A>, or
<A href="clcs.ps">Postscript</A>.

<p>
<li>`The Development of the C Language', from HOPL II, 1993:
<br><a href="chist.html">browsable</a>,
or printable <a href="chist.ps">PostScript</a> or

<br>
Angelo de Oliveira kindly supplied a translation into
Portuguese of the paper; his own MS Word
version is <A href="chistPT.doc">here</A>, while
<A href="chistPT.html">this</A> is Word's rendition of
this into browsable HTML.

<p>
<li>
An <A href="hopl.html">HTML browsable transcript</A>
of the talk I gave at HOPL II, with its slides.
It's entitled "Five Little Languages and How They Grew"
and it is quite different from the Development paper referenced just above.

<p>

Journal of C Language Translation, but is not the approach adopted for the
1999 ISO C standard:

entertainment that led Ken to find the PDP-7 that would become important.

involved in stronger political forces and higher mathematical creativity than is his wont.

<li>A <A href="ken-games.html">brief article</A>
I wrote for ICGA Journal, the publication of the International
Computer Games Association, recounting an appreciation of the
synergy between Ken Thompson's activities in chess, other games, and
systems.  It includes a funny faked memo by Mike Lesk.

<li> <A href="bsdi/bsdisuit.html">
Some court papers</A>
from the lawsuit brought by USL against BSDI,
then the University of California, in the early 1990s about Unix
intellectual property.
These may be relevant today in view of SCO's
recent actions.

<h2>
Plan 9 and Inferno
</h2>

<ul>

<li>The new, open-source edition of the
<A HREF="https://s3.amazonaws.com/plan9-bell-labs/plan9/index.html">Plan 9</A> system is available.
I contributed only a few bits and pieces to it, but did,
in effect, sign some paychecks to keep it going.
<p>

<li>
The system-structuring ideas of Plan 9 were adopted also by
the Inferno system, now distributed by
<A HREF="http://www.vitanuova.com">Vita Nuova</A>.
Again, this was more a matter of signing paychecks than
doing the work, though I did write about it.
